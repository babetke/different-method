I am a PhD Candidate in the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior program at the University of Texas at Austin in the [Meyers lab](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/), co-advised by [Nicole Gottdenker DVM, MS, PhD, Dipl. ACVP.](https://www.gottdenkerlab.com/). 

I use a statistical modeling approach to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic environments on vector-borne pathogen exposure risk in humans and companion animals. In addition, I am taking a machine learning approach to understand how the use of anthropogenic structures as roosts influence viral diversity in bats.
