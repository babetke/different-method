I am a disease ecologist interested in the assessing the impacts of urbanization and synanthropic behavior on host&ndashpathogen interactions with the aim to improve prediction of reservoir hosts and pathogen emergence.

I am an NSF Postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Oklahoma working in the [Becker lab](http://beckerlab.weebly.com/) where I combine machine learning, field, and molecular techniques to predict and validate bat&ndashvirus family associations in the context of anthropogenic roosting behavior. I completed my PhD in the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior program at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Lauren Ancel Meyers, PhD](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) and [Nicole Gottdenker DVM, MS, PhD, Dipl. ACVP.](https://www.gottdenkerlab.com/)
