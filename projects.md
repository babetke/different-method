**Interests**

Broadly, I am interested in the ecology of disease in wildlife and humans. More specifically, my interests include understanding the impacts of urbanization on:

* wildlife health
* host-pathogen interactions
* human-wildlife interactions 

**Graduate Research**

Dissertation Projects:

* Granular spatial analysis of vector-borne pathogen exposure risk in owned companion animals in Georgia, USA with [Nicole Gottdenker DVM, MS, PhD, Dipl. ACVP.](https://www.gottdenkerlab.com/)
* Sociodemographic and ecological associations with county-level human cases of Murine Typhus in Texas, USA.
* Anthropogenic roosting and viral diversity in bats using a machine learning approach with [Daniel Becker, PhD](http://beckerlab.weebly.com/) and viral association data from [Verena Consortium](https://www.viralemergence.org/). Preliminary analysis was presented at ESA 2022 and the poster can be downloaded <a href="https://babetke.github.io/images/ESA 2022 Poster.pdf"> here.</a> 

Other projects:

* Spatial distribution of COVID-19 hospitalization risk in the greater Austin area, USA in collaboration with Emily Javan and the [UT Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/). This work was presented at the 2020 UT COVID Conference and the poster can be found [here.](https://airtable.com/shrGb7V5X5UKbEugG/tbl5TPwuDHlJ5cmL2/viwLXY9IEsuUd6jgp/recNpYF9kxeKqNfF9)
* Descriptive analysis of Bartonella spp. in companion animals paired with pediatric cases of Cat-Scratch disease in Georgia, USA with [Christina A. Rostad, MD and team](https://www.pedsresearch.org/people/faculty/christina-rostad) and Nicole Gottdenker DVM, MS, PhD, Dipl. ACVP. This work has been accepted for publication at Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Look out for the paper in my publication section!

**Undergraduate Research**

My undergraduate research focussed on assessing the relationship between stress levels, determined by fecal glucocorticoids, and forage quality in Sonoran pronghorn with [David Christianson, PhD](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nehjEWUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Wildlife Endocrinology Lab.](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/ecology/webpages/people/people.html)
