**Postdoctoral research: Identifying and Validating Missing Links in the Global Bat-Virus Network**

A major challenge to the field of disease ecology is fully characterizing hostpathogen
networks because species interaction data is often incomplete and biased, owing to
the high logistical costs (e.g., time and funding) and thus infeasibility of exhaustive sampling of
these associations. This has consequences for the prevention and control of diseases of
human, domestic animal, and wildlife concern. Predicting missing links in the global bat-virus
network is of particular interest because many bat associated viruses have high zoonotic
potential and the investment in the surveillance of these viruses is high, leading to a growing
body of available data. In addition, bats show intraspecific variation in roosting ecology as many
bat species are found to occupy both anthropogenic and natural structure types, thus potentially
shaping virus presence and viral communities within species. This project aims to identify
unrecorded, but likely, bat–virus family associations, which will then be used to inform
hypothesis-driven fieldwork. I will quantify the probability of interactions between bat species
and virus families with link prediction models and then test these predictions as well as assess
intraspecific variation in associations across roost structure type (anthropogenic or natural) in
bats sampled in Oklahoma and Texas.

**Graduate Research**

The rapid global conversion of natural habitat to built environments create corridors that facilitate cross-species transmission at the human–domestic animal–wildlife interface. Understanding pathogen outcomes of animals that live directly at this interface will provide insight into the transmission dynamics of pathogens that pose risk to companion animals, wildlife, and humans. This dissertation is comprised of two sections where I studied pathogen outcomes in two groups of animals that live directly alongside humans: wildlife that live in anthropogenic structures (eg, buildings, bridges, homes, and tunnels, etc.) and companion animals. In the first section, a novel database of anthropogenic roosting ecology in bats was created to identify ecological and evolutionary determinants of anthropogenic roosting ability. Then,the importance of this ability in predicting viral outcomes was assessed using a machine learning approach. In the second section of this dissertation, data was compiled from veterinary diagnostic reports to evaluate the influence of climactic and land use factors on vector-borne pathogen exposure risk in canines.

**Undergraduate Research**

My undergraduate research focused on assessing the relationship between stress levels, determined by fecal glucocorticoids, and forage quality in Sonoran pronghorn with [David Christianson, PhD](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nehjEWUAAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Wildlife Endocrinology Lab.](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/ecology/webpages/people/people.html)
