**About**

Before joining the Meyers lab at the University of Texas at Austin for my PhD, I received my bachelor's degree in Natural Resources (emphasis on Wildlife Conservation and Management) with a minor in Veterinary Science at the University of Arizona. As an undergraduate, I participated in the Undergraduate Biological Research Program (UBRP) and the Doris Duke Conservation Scholar Program (DDCSP). I was the lead lab technician of the [Wildlife Endocrinology Lab](https://cals.arizona.edu/research/ecology/webpages/people/people.html) and an intern at the [Laboratory for the Evolutionary Endocrinology of Primates (LEEP)](https://leepanthropology.weebly.com/people.html). While I participated in DDCSP, I interned at the California Department of Wildlife's investigations lab, known as WIL. Where I assisted with the surveillance of diseases in wildlife. All of these experiences informed me about the human related impacts of wildlife health and propelled me towards a graduate career in Disease Ecology!

My interests outside of research (in no particular order...but I do really like books...):
- Long walks with my Husband and dogs
- Reading
- Gardening
