## Mentoring and Outreach

**Minorities in Biological Research (MBR)**

I was an organizing member of the [Minorities in Biological Research Program](https://minoritiesinbiologicalresearch.weebly.com) at the University of Texas at Austin. MBR is a program intended to provide information to undergraduate students of underrepresented groups relating to preparing for graduate school or a career in research. I assist with the organizing of workshops and the development of content such as handouts. In March of 2021, I presented on the graduate panel to show students my path to graduate school. 

**Mentorship**

Through the ESA SEEDs program, I mentored 10 students during the 2019 ESA annual conference. I assisted students with navigating the conference and creating professional networks. 

Through the Alumni Leadership Cohort, I mentored a current undergraduate student in the DDCSP Collaborative.
